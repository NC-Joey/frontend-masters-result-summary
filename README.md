### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt about adding using font-face in CSS and alos adding favicon to a site

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./assets/images/favicon-32x32.png">
```
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: "HankenGrotesk";
    src: url(./assets/fonts/HankenGrotesk-VariableFont_wght.ttf);
}
```


### Continued development

Hopefully, one day, I'll add a form first which will be filled with the scores data and saved as a JSON file. The file will then be used in the result summary component
